# Image Captioning Project

## Overview
This project implements an image captioning model that generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for caption generation.

## Features
- Generates captions for images using a trained deep learning model.
- Utilizes pre-trained models for feature extraction to improve performance.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for testing the model with new images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
   cd image-captioning
